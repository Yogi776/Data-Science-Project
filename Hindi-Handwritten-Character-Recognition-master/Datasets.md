The original dataset has been taken from the below mentioned site. Since the data was stored in a directory structure I have their csv files after downloading the data locally. These csv files have then been uploaded to Google Drive.
The link for the data - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Devanagari+Handwritten+Character+Dataset

The dataset was huge and could not be uploaded to github. So I have added a Google Drive link - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oIbkgV0nVchCfysMi5wZ0XrK-6C3tc2q?usp=sharing
